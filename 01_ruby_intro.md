# Ruby Intro

## Check your ruby version
Check which version of ruby you have installed (compare this to the version that should be installed according to the instructor)

## Floats and integers 
What do you think happens when you combine the following floats and integers? Is the result a float or an integer? If an operator is unfamiliar, look it up and learn what it does. Check yourself using IRB.
1. 3.0 / 2
2. 3 / 2.0
3. 4 ** 2.0
4. 4.1 % 2

## Strings
What do you think the output will be if you type these into IRB? Record the output you expect, and the actual (if it is different).
1. "tom" * 3
2. "tom" + "tom"
3. "tom" + 1
4. "tom" / 2

## Calculations in IRB
Try these calculations in IRB
1. How many hours are in a year?
2. How many minutes are in a decade?
3. How many seconds old are you?
